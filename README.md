# Wenyi Zhang
Shader-driven real-time interactive systems · Technical Artist / Creative Developer  
New York · Unreal Engine · TouchDesigner · HLSL/GLSL · Python · WebGPU/WebXR

I build **production-minded real-time graphics + tooling**—the kind that survives deadlines, sensors, and messy pipelines.  
My work sits between **rendering, interaction, and systems**: visuals that look sharp, run fast, and plug into real-world workflows.

**Focus now:** Unreal C++ rendering extensions, performance-aware pipelines, and browser-native realtime (WebGPU/WebXR).
