# Wenyi Zhang
Shader-driven real-time interactive systems · Technical Artist / Creative Developer  
New York · Unreal Engine · TouchDesigner · HLSL/GLSL · Python · WebGPU/WebXR

I build **production-minded real-time graphics + tooling**—the kind that survives deadlines, sensors, and messy pipelines.  
My work sits between **rendering, interaction, and systems**: visuals that look sharp, run fast, and plug into real-world workflows.

**Focus now:** Unreal C++ rendering extensions, performance-aware pipelines, and browser-native realtime (WebGPU/WebXR).

---

## What I do
- **Real-time rendering & shaders**: custom materials, GPU simulations, HLSL/GLSL, realtime look-dev
- **Unreal Engine systems**: tools, runtime features, XR/interactive builds, plugin-minded development
- **Pipeline & automation**: Python tooling, asset ingestion/export, repeatable workflows
- **Sensors / robotics integration**: OSC + hardware-driven interaction (camera / control loops / external devices)
- **Research-minded prototyping**: fast experiments → stable systems (art + engineering without the fake wall)

---

## Selected stack
**Realtime:** Unreal Engine (UE5), TouchDesigner, Houdini  
**GPU / Shading:** HLSL, GLSL (learning WGSL)  
**Code:** Python, C++ (Unreal), TypeScript/React (for tools + dashboards)  
**Systems:** Docker, basic observability patterns (logs/metrics), CI-friendly tooling  
**Interchange / Data:** Alembic/USD-ish thinking, metadata export, reproducible renders

---

## How I work
I like building **small, sharp prototypes** that can graduate into **maintainable tools**:
- measurable performance (profiling over vibes)
- clear interfaces (artists + engineers can both use it)
- documentation that future-me won’t curse present-me for
